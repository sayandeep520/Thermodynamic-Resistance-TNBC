# Thermodynamic-Resistance-TNBC
A physics-based framework for reversing TNBC drug resistance. Using Topological Data Analysis on scRNA-seq, we mapped a COL17A1-driven phase transition at pseudotime 0.7. Includes in silico trials disrupting the COL17A1-MT2A anchor, demonstrating the thermodynamic collapse of the resistant attractor back to a sensitive state.
